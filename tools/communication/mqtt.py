# Communication module, based on MQTT protocol, since different module instance may be deployed to different server.

# Every client keeps a keep-alive connection to MQTT Core, which may be a mosquitto-mqtt core.

# New class with MQTT comm. ability may extend this class. If the main purpose for the client is to subscribe topics
# and receive msgs, it should implement callback methods on_subscribe, on_message then subscribe topics.

# If the main purpose is only to send out some logs, go checkout tools.io.logging, which uses simple_publish method here
# simple_publish only needs minimal configuration params, doesn't create any instance.

# MQTT Proto defines connect, subscribe operations,
#   connect operation would be done within __init__() automatically.
#   subscribe should be called manually.
#   mqtt_sub_thread_cancel should be called to clean after yourself
